I am currently a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn), major in transportation engineering. I received my bechelor degree in Civil Engineering and a minor in law from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) in 2017. Since 2013, I studied in and visited several universities, including Zhejiang University, University of Tokyo, Waseda University, University of Toronto, University of Ottawa, Western University, Queens Unversity, York University. My current research interests are urban network traffic state identification and traffic flow modeling. I have published several articles as well participated in a couple of national and municipal research projects related to my research interests.

As a curious and passionate learner, apart from my research field, I covered knowledge of various areas, such as law, computer science, economics, social science, etc. During my spare time, I actively involved in student activities and volunteering. I hope the world could become slightly better owning to my contribution.
