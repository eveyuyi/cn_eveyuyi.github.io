I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Civil Engineering and architecture at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) since 2017, major in Highway and transportation engineering. I received my bechelor degree in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn) in 2017, meanwhile minor in law. 

My current research interests are urban traffic state identification and traffic flow modeling. I have published several articles related to my research interests.
